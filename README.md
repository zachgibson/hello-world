# hello-world

*I've never gone through this hello world example, so I'm doing it now.*

I design and prototype mobile apps. I’m a fan of rad socks, outer space, pepperoni jalapeño pizza, and Ancient Aliens; I’m obsessed with caffeinated problem solving, prototyping with React Native, Tolkien fantasy, and the internet.
